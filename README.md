# 02_Module_Portfolio

### User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```


### Developer notes

In creating this website I challenged myself to create something colorful and graphic without being overwhelming to the user. I wanted it to be inspired by 70s graphic design. The biggest challenge was creating the cascading borders, especially since it made scaling the internal card content difficult as it would keep colliding with the borders as it shrunk. Using media screens I manually set breakpoints to make sure that the card content wouldn't overlap with the borders at any size. I believe there are better solutions to keep the content from colliding with the cascading borders, but for now I am happy with the result. 

I also opted to design my own avatar rather than use a photo to give the website a more personal touch.

For my work section I opted to link cards both to the previous homework and to several publications I am an author on.

This was a fun and challenging task - while there are some small things I would like to fix, overall I am satisfied with my end product.
